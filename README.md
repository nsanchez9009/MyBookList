# MyBookList ðŸ“š
<p>MyBookList is an online book tracking app. You can add books by providing the title, author, number of pages, and if you have or have not read it.</p>

View MyBookList <a href="https://nsanchez9009.github.io/MyBookList/">here</a>!

<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>MyBookList currently does not store any information, so refreshing or closing the page will delete all your data. Soon I will be adding online and local storage options.
